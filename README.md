# athletic_sales_analysis
This analysis shows which cities in the U.S. have had the most atheletic sales over two years. I analyzed the data to determine which retailers had the greatest total sales for athetic wear, and which retailers sold the most women's atheltic footwear. I also determined which day and week had the highest sales for women's athletic footwear.
